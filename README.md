# Algos_Practice
Practice Questions from where website like Leetcode, HackerRank amd general algorithms

"add_binary.py" - takes two binary numbers as input in form of strings, and returns their sum as output as a string.

"count_n_say.py" - Generate nth term of Count and Say sequence using iterative method.

"fibonacci.py" - Generate fibonacci nth term using simple recursion.

"fibonacci_memo.py" - Generate fibonacci nth term using recursion and memoization.

"group_anagram.py" - From a list of strings, this code classifies all the groups of anagrams together.

"insertion_sort.py" - Basic insertion sort algorithm. 

"length_longest_substr.py" - Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

"length_last_word.py" - Given a string, finds the length of last valid word (no-whitespaces).

"long_common_prefix.py" - This finds the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

"median_sorted_arrays.py" - This finds the median of two sorted arrays using merge sort in O(log(m+n)). 

"merge_arrays.py" - Basic merge O(log(m+n)) algorithm for merging two sorted lists. 

"palindrome_num.py" - simple algo to determine if a number is a palindrome, without using any string conversions. 

"plus_one.py" - given non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, this adds one to the integer and returns the integer in array format. 

"merge_intervals.py" - Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals. This implementation is slow and uses lot of memory, needs to be simplified.

"multipy_string.py" - Given two integers in form of strings, this multiplies and returns an integer without explicit string to integer conversion.

"remv_duplicates.py" - Given a sorted array, removes the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and returns the new length.

"remv_elem.py" - Given an array nums and a value val, this removes all instances of that value in-place and returns the new length

"reverse_integer.py" - Given a 32-bit signed integer, this reverses digits of an integer. This implementation does not use strings.

"reverse_words.py" - Given a string, this reverses all the words in that string. This implementation does not use any inbuilt pythonic funcitons like splitting.

"roman_to_int.py" - A simple algo to convert a roman number in form of a string to a decimal integer. 

"search_insert.py" - Given a sorted array and a target value, uses binary search to return the index where the target should be inserted in the array.

"strStr.py" - needle and haystack problem, find the position of substring in a string, and return -1 if it does not exist.

"string_to_integer.py" - this implements a function which converts a string into the integer (assuming 32 bit machine), similar to "atoi"

"two_sum_easy.py" - Given an array of integers, returns indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

"valid_anagram_basic.py" - Given two strings, finds if one string is a valid anagram of the other, using O(n^2) time.

"valid_anagram_hash.py" - Given two strings, find if one string is a valid anagram of the other, using hashmap implementation and O(n) time. 

"valid_parentheses.py" - Given a string, check if different types of paranthesis are balanced.
