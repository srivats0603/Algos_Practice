Practice Questions from where website like Leetcode, HackerRank amd general algorithms

"countNsay.py" - Generate nth term of Count and Say sequence using iterative method.

"fibonacci.py" - Generate fibonacci nth term using simple recursion.

"fibonacci_memo.py" - Generate fibonacci nth term using recursion and memoization.

"insertion_sort.py" - Basic insertion sort algorithm. 

"length_longest_substr.py" - Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

"long_common_prefix.py" - This finds the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

"medianSortedArrays.py" - This finds the median of two sorted arrays using merge sort in O(log(m+n)). 

"mergeArrays.py" - Basic merge O(log(m+n)) algorithm for merging two sorted lists. 

"mergeIntervals.py" - Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals. This implementation is slow and uses lot of memory, needs to be simplified.

"remv_duplicates.py" - Given a sorted array, removes the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and returns the new length.

"remv_elem.py" - Given an array nums and a value val, removes all instances of that value in-place and returns the new length

"reverse_integer.py" - Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer. This implementation does not use strings.

"strStr.py" - needle and haystack problem, find the position of substring in a string, and return -1 if it does not exist.

"two_sum_easy.py" - Given an array of integers, returns indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

"valid_anagram_basic.py" - Given two strings, finds if one string is a valid anagram of the other, using O(n^2) time.

"valid_anagram_hash.py" - Given two strings, find if one string is a valid anagram of the other, using hashmap implementation and O(n) time. 

"valid_parentheses.py" - Given a string, check if different types of paranthesis are balanced.
